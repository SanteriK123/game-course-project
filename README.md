Sewer Cave Escape is a top-down 2d roguelite very reminscient of games like Nuclear throne or Diablo, though it plays much worse and is more of a concept than an actually fun game at this point. Regardless, it includes procedurally generated levels that gradually increase in difficulty, and an epic boss fight at stage 5 that ends the game.
